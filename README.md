# Jenny

_Jenny_ is a static blog generator. Its aim is to work with minimal requirements and a small footprint while providing some modern conveniences.

- [x] Basic pagination with fixed page numbers
- [x] Plug your own Markdown parser
- [x] Heredocs-based template syntax
- [x] Draft/ignore support (by leaving out the date)
- [x] Forward-posting, i.e. ignores posts with dates in the future
- [x] Tags support
- [x] Modifiable installation prefix
- [x] Define run-time settings in command arguments
- [x] Include static directories in build
- [x] Unique URL slug generation
- [x] Render only changed or new posts
- [x] RSS/Atom feed
- [ ] Tests


## Getting started, three ways 

#### 1. You can install `jenny` to your local bin folder

```
git clone https://github.com/hmngwy/jenny.git
make install
```

#### 2. Or, skip installation and use Docker, all references to the command `jenny` is interchangeable with the below

```
docker run -it -v $PWD:/blog hmngwy/jenny:latest
```

The Docker image contains Multimarkdown 6 so you can have `MARKDOWN_COMMAND="multimarkdown "` in your `.blogrc`.

#### 3. Or, as a Github Action to automatically build your blog

This repository is also the Github Action source, simply reference it in your Worflow steps, below is an example.

```
on: [push]

jobs:
  build_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name:  Build with Jenny
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - uses: hmngwy/jenny@master
```

You can fork the [hmngwy/jenny-template](https://github.com/hmngwy/jenny-template) repo to start using `jenny` without installing a thing.

## Setting up a Blog

Prepare the directory for your blog posts.

```
mkdir ./blog && cd blog
```

Use the subcommand below to initialize your blog folder with a `.blogrc` file and a sample first post.

```
jenny init
```

## Creating a Blog Post

A dated filename will be recognized as a published post, everything else is a draft and ignored, the format is:

```
YYYY-MM-DD a-published-post.md
```

Create a file with a date so that Jenny recognizes it as a published post.

```
cat <<EOT >> "$(date +%Y-%m-%d) hello-world.md"
# Hello World

Jenny is a static blog generator using bash, sed, and awk.
EOT
```

## Building the Blog

Run `jenny` on your blog directory.

## Command Line Arguments

To override `.blogrc` settings at run-time use command line arguments. Other options are also available, use `jenny -h` to display the message below:

```
jenny usage:
   -d ./dir   Override the build directory setting
   -p 10      Override posts per page setting
   -l ./dir   Override layout directory setting
   -m mmd     Override the markdown parser command setting
   -v         Display more information during building
   -n         Ignore the .bloglock file when building
   -c         Empty out the build folder prior to building
   -h         Show this help message
```

### Handy Shortcuts

```bash
# Publish file with current date
jenny publish filename.md

# Edit file without typing date/full filename
jenny edit partial-filename
```

## .blogrc settings

To configure posts per page:

```
POSTS_PER_PAGE=10
```

To use your own markdown parser, set `MARKDOWN_COMMAND`:

```
MARKDOWN_COMMAND=multimarkdown
```

To run a script after the build process, write a `post_hook` function in .blogrc:

```
function post_hook() {
  echo "Done!"
}
```

To set a different build folder, set `DIST`:

```
DIST=~/blog/.dist
```

To copy directories into the build folder:

```
STATIC_DIRS="images files"
```

## Post Formatting

Titles are Markdown H1s. Multimarkdown footnotes syntax supported in the vendored parser.

To use tags add the below into a post where `tagname` is both filename and URL friendly:

```
tags: tagname anothertag
```

## Theme Customization

From the project folder, copy the layout folder contents and modify to your liking, mind the template tags.

```cp -R ./share/jenny/layout ~/blog/.layout```

Let Jenny know where to find your customized layout files.

```
cat <<EOT >> .blogrc
LAYOUT_DIR=~/blog/.layout
EOT
```

## Alternative Installation Modes

To soft install or symlink into your bin folder, good for contributing/development: 
```
sudo make sym-install [PREFIX=$PWD]
```

To install into a custom location do: ```make install [PREFIX=~/.local]```

To uninstall, in the project folder run: ```make uninstall```
